    <h2 class="section-heading text-center">The MBTI personality type</h2>
    <p> Have you ever wonder why you are unique from other people? Do you know your own personality? The Myers-Briggs Personality Type Indicator is a popular quiz designed to let you identify your unique personality, strengths, and preferences. This short quiz will let you get to know yourself better! </p>
<br>
    <h2 class="section-heading text-center">Why a Spirit Animal?</h2>
    <p> On Egao, we pair each personality type with an animal that shares similar characteristics. This animal will be your spirit animal that you can rely on, share your feelings and emotions with, and accompany you through your journey. Your spirit animal will also be your avatar on Egao, where you can check in and check out with at anytime. </p>

    <div class="about">
<p class="left-align">This App was designed with kids in mind. During the pandemic (COVID-19) kids had to stay home so they couldn't play. Children from the ages six to fourteen had to stay indoors and lose social interaction as the semesters went by. Egao (Smiley Face) was created to help ease the mind for kids who were struggling with mental health issues that were caused by the pandemic. </p>
<p class="left-align">As of now the app is meant to reward kids with smiles using games and activities that can improve their mood and social well being.</p>
<p class="left-align">We hope to improve the app over time and provide statistics to parents and teachers so they can track their child's progress. Parents would also be able to see what their children's mood is like and see how they can improve it.</p>
